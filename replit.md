# AI Document Search & Chat (RAG Chatbot)

## Overview

This is a full-stack AI-powered document search and chat application that implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. The system allows users to upload PDF documents, automatically processes them into searchable chunks with vector embeddings, and provides an intelligent chat interface where users can ask questions about their documents. The AI responds with contextually relevant answers and includes source citations from the uploaded materials.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application uses a modern React-based frontend built with:
- **React 18** with JavaScript for modern component patterns
- **TailwindCSS** with custom design system featuring glassmorphism effects and 3D-like visual elements
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and interactive transitions
- **shadcn/ui** component library providing a comprehensive set of accessible UI primitives
- **Tanstack React Query** for efficient server state management and caching
- **wouter** as a lightweight routing solution

The frontend implements a responsive design with dark/light mode theming and follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns between UI components, hooks, and utility functions.

### Backend Architecture
The backend is built on **Node.js with Express.js** following a RESTful API design:
- **Express.js** server with middleware for request processing and error handling
- **Multer** for handling multipart file uploads with memory storage
- **Service layer architecture** separating concerns between PDF processing, AI integration, and vector storage
- **Memory-based storage implementation** with interface abstraction allowing for future database integration

### Data Storage Solutions
The system uses a hybrid approach for data persistence:
- **PostgreSQL** with Drizzle ORM for structured data (documents, conversations, messages, chunks)
- **In-memory storage** as the current implementation with database schema ready for production deployment
- **Vector storage** using either FAISS (local fallback) or Pinecone (cloud-based) for semantic search capabilities
- **File system storage** for temporary PDF processing

The database schema includes tables for documents, document chunks, conversations, and messages with proper relationships and indexing for efficient queries.

### AI Integration Architecture
The application integrates with Google's Gemini API for both embedding generation and chat responses:
- **Text embedding generation** using the `text-embedding-004` model for semantic search
- **Chat completion** with context injection for RAG-based responses
- **Document chunking** using a custom recursive character text splitter optimized for PDF content
- **Semantic search** with cosine similarity scoring for relevant content retrieval

### Vector Search Implementation
The vector store service provides semantic search capabilities:
- **Embedding creation** for all document chunks during processing
- **Similarity search** using vector comparisons for query matching
- **Source attribution** linking search results back to original documents with page numbers and excerpts
- **Configurable similarity thresholds** for result filtering

## External Dependencies

### AI Services
- **Google Gemini API** - Primary AI service for text embeddings and chat completions
- **Pinecone** (optional) - Cloud-based vector database for production-scale vector storage
- **FAISS** (fallback) - Local vector similarity search when Pinecone is unavailable

### Database
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database for structured data storage (configured but using memory storage currently)
- **Neon Database** - Serverless PostgreSQL provider integration via connection string

### Frontend Libraries
- **Radix UI** - Accessible component primitives for complex UI elements
- **Framer Motion** - Animation library for smooth transitions and interactions
- **React Hook Form** - Form state management with validation
- **React Dropzone** - File upload interface with drag-and-drop support

### Development Tools
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server with hot module replacement
- **JavaScript** - Modern ES6+ implementation with full module support
- **Drizzle Kit** - Database migration and schema management
- **ESBuild** - Fast JavaScript bundler for production builds

### Authentication & Session Management
- **Express Sessions** - Session management with PostgreSQL store integration
- **Connect PG Simple** - PostgreSQL session store for production deployment

The architecture is designed to be scalable and maintainable, with clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data layers. The system can handle multiple concurrent users and documents while maintaining responsive performance through efficient caching and query optimization strategies.
